# "Learn from a website" repo

This is what you do when you want work on an iOS tutorial on  two machines, make a github repo that I'll probably forget to delete some day. If you too want to learn how to make a pointless bull's eye game in service of learning swift, go to this [website](http://www.raywenderlich.com/category/swift) and sign up for their newsletter (and get a free tutorial, worth it!).
